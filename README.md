# LSSTprep
Repository for Richards group LSST prep work, specifically related to the AGN SC.  Maintained by gtr@physics.drexel.edu
 
LCmerge -- Notebooks related to trying to understand how we can best
merge light curves from multiple bands to produce a single light
curve, both for the purpose of deciding whether an object is variable
or not and for determining the properties of the variability.  Started
by Drexel undergrad Jared Haughton (Drexel 2018), currently maintained
by Drexel undergrad co-op student Rachel Buttry (Drexel 2019).

GAIA -- Notebooks related to determining under what conditions GAIA can be used to improve quasar selection in LSST.  The bottom line is roughly that all quasars brighter than $i=20$ will be detected by GAIA, but essentially no quasars fainter than $i=22$ will be.  Currently maintained by Drexel undergrad co-op student Ben Martin (Drexel 2020).

Photoz -- Notebooks exploring different aspect of photo-z's for AGNs
in LSST.  Currently maintained by Drexel undergrad co-op student Ben
Martin (Drexel 2020).
