### LSSTPrep/Training Set

This sub-folder provides a brief overview of the AGN classification training set that we are building here at Drexel in Richards' group. This work is led by Drexel graduate student Weixiang Yu. To check out a little survey about public AGN light curves, please see "Public_LCs.ipynb". To learn about what we have done, please start with the notebook "GetStarted.ipynb".

This process is by no means complete yet, and we are only starting. If you are interested in playing with our data set (and is part of the LSST AGN SC), you can create a SciServer account and send us your username, then we can provide you access. The "sciserver.pdf" document gives fairly detailed instructions on how to get an account on SciServer.
